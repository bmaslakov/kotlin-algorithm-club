/**
 * Shellsort, also known as Shell sort or Shell's method, is an in-place comparison sort. It can be seen as either a
 * generalization of sorting by exchange (bubble sort) or sorting by insertion (insertion sort). The method starts by
 * sorting pairs of elements far apart from each other, then progressively reducing the gap between elements to be
 * compared. Starting with far apart elements, it can move some out-of-place elements into position faster than
 * a simple nearest neighbor exchange. Donald Shell published the first version of this sort in 1959.
 * This implementation uses the gap sequence proposed by Pratt in 1971: 1, 4, 13, 40...
