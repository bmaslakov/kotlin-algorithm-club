/**
 * Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares
 * each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated
 * until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort,
 * is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list. Although the algorithm is simple,
 * it is too slow and impractical for most problems even when compared to insertion sort. It can be practical
 * if the input is usually in sorted order but may occasionally have some out-of-order elements nearly in position.
